<CENTER><B> Reflection and change have been marked this year some days feel good and others feel weird.We have learned to work differently, and more unconditionally, to love.
We try to cope with stress, but sometimes life still feels like a mess.We're finding ways to turn the negative into good, and learning new skills that we thought we could never do.We find ways to travel to less congested places, and we encounter our own Friends with their faces covered.
I hope this year has been filled with opportunity and we have tried to exercise our immunity and strengthen it. 2020 wasn't the way we expected it to be, but we found new ways to stay connected.Hug your children and enjoy the outdoors; worry less about the chores that are very small.Because they usually do, things will get better enjoy what you love and learn something new.
Don't forget to pray and be kind at all times try to remain positive and learn to unwind.
The story is written, good wins at the end prayers for all my friends and family. </B></CENTER>
